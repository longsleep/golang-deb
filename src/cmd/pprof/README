The pprof in this directory is adapted from the pprof used inside Google
for C++, Java, and Go programs. Because it was developed for that broader
context, it is overgeneralized when used here for the specific use case
of profiling standard Go programs. However, we've left the abstractions
intact in order to share updates between this copy and Google's internal one.

Please do not take the level of abstraction in this program as an example
to follow in your own.
