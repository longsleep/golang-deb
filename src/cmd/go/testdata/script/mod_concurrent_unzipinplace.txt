# This tests checks the GODEBUG=modcacheunzipinplace=1 flag, used as part of
# a migration in golang.org/issue/36568.
#
# Concurrent downloads with and without GODEBUG=modcacheunzipinplace=1 should
# not conflict. This is meant to simulate an old version and a new version
# of Go accessing the cache concurrently.
