Subject: [PATCH] cmd/dist: increase default timeout scale for arm

Forwarded: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43002

Most developers use (faster) amd64 machines setting the test timeouts,
but test may run on slower arm ones and also different tests may suffer
different relative slowdown on the arm CPUs.

Due to those two varying factors it is safer to allow a higher timeout
scale on arm to avoid tests timing out.
